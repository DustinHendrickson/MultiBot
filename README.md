# MultiBot
User interface for AzerothCore-Module "Playerbot" by Liyunfan1223.<br>
Tested with American and German 3.3.5 Wotlk-Client.
# Installation
Simply place the files in a folder called "MultiBot" in your World of Warcraft AddOns directory.<br>
Example: "C:\WorldOfWarcraft\Interface\AddOns\MultiBot"
# Use
Start World of Warcraft and enter "/multibot" or "/mbot" or "/mb" in the chat.
# Current Status
Reads the character list and offers a button for the available Playerbots.<br>
Simply press the corresponding button to start the Playerbot.<br><br>
The interface retrieves the current strategies and offers a selection structure for settings.<br>
This allows you to define the behavior of the individual player bots.<br><br>
Various strategies depend on each other or cancel each other out.<br>
I tried to display the dependencies in the user interface.<br>
This is the reason why the tank button goes off when you activate the DPS button.<br><br>
I also added a simple group control.<br>
Buttons are available for the following actions:<br>
<ul>
<li>@Tank attack my Target</li>
<li>Group attack my Target</li>
<li>Toggle passive mode</li>
<li>Stay or Follow</li>
<li>Group Release</li>
<li>Group Revive</li>
<li>Group Summon of all active Bots</li>
</ul>
With my last Update I added a simple Inventory.<br>
The basic functions are:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Left click the Backpack-Icon to open and close the Inventory</li>
<li>Left click on Items will sell them to the targeted Merchent</li>
<li>Right click on Items will drop them</li>
</ul>

# Currently not supported
RAID - QUEST<br>
# Missing Class Icons
Some client versions doesn't support the Class-Icons.<br>
So I replaced them with a Scroll-Icon.
